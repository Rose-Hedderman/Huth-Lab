thatyou learnthis time i'll play possumand next timei'll just be real nice or i'll say yes to everything or you make yourself scarce or you runand this was one of the times when you just runand as i was running i thought this was a great place to jump out because there were big lawns and there were cul de sacs and sometimes he would come after me and drive and yell stuff at me to get back in get back in and i was like no i'm out of here this is great and i went and hid behind a cabana and he leftand i had my cigarettesand uh i started to walk in this beautiful neighborhood it was ten thirty at nightandit was silentand lovelyandthere was no sound except forsprinklersch ch ch ch{ig}ch ch ch ch {ig}and i was enjoying myself and enjoying the absence of anger and enjoying these few hours i knew i'd have of freedomand just to perfect iti thought i'll have a smoke and then it occurred to me with horrifying speed i don't have a lightjust then as if in answer i see a figure up ahead who is thatit's not him ok they don't have a dog who is that what uh what are they doing out on this suburban street and the person comes closer and i could see it's a womanand then i can see she has her hands in her face oh she's crying and then she sees me and she composes herselfand she gets closer and i see she has no shoes on she has no shoes on and she's crying and she's out on the streetstreeti recognize herthough i've never met her and just as she passes me she says you got a cigaretteand i say you got a lightand she says damn i hope soand then sh first she digs into her cutoffs in the frontnothing and then digs in the back and then she has this vest on that has fifty million little pockets on it and she's checking and checking and it's looking bad it's looking very badshe digs back in the front again deep deep and she pulls out a pack of matches that had been laundered at least onceukgh we open it up and there is one match insideok oh my god this takes on it's like nasa now we got to like oh how are we gonna do it ok and we we hunker down we crouch on the groundandwhere's the wind coming from we're stopping i take out my cigarettes let's get the cigarettes ready oh my brand she says not surprisingand we both have our cigarettes at the ready she strikes once nothing she strikes again yes firepuff inhale mm sweet kiss of that cigaretteand we sit there and we're loving the nicotine and we both need this right now i can tell the night's been toughimmediately we start to reminisce about our thirty second relationship i didn't think that was gonna happen me neither oh man that was close oh i'm so lucky i saw you yeahthen she surprises me by sayingwhat was the fight aboutand i say wha what are they all about and she said i know what you mean she said was it a bad one and and i said you know like mediumshe said oh and we start to trade stories about our liveswe're both from up northwe're both kind of newish to the neighborhood this is in floridawe both went to college not great colleges but man we graduatedand i'm actually finding myself a little jealous of her because she has this really cool job washing dogsshe had horses back home and she really loves animals and she wants to be a vet and i'm like man you're halfway therei'm a waitressat an ice cream parlor so um that's not i don't know where i want to be but i know it's not thatand then it gets a little deeper {cg} and we share some other stuffabout what our lives are like things that i can't ever tell people at homethis girli can tell her the really ugly stuff and she still understands how it can still be prettyshe understands like how nicehe's gonna be when i get homeand how sweet that'll bewe are chain smoking off each other oh that's almost out come on and we we go through this entire pack until it's gone and then i say you know whatuh this is a little funny but you're gonna have to show me the way to get home because although i'm twenty three years old i don't have my driver's license yet and i just jumped out right when i needed toand she says well why don't you come back to my house and i'll give you a ridei say ok greatand we start walkingand uh we get to this umlots of uh lights and uh the roads are getting wider and wider and there's more cars and i see umlots of stores you know laundromats anddollar stores and emergecenters andthen we cross over us one and uh she leads me to some place and i think nobut yescarl's efficiency apartmentsthis girl lives thereand it's horrible and it's lit up so bright just to illuminate the horribleness of it it's the kind of place where you drive your car right up and the door's right there and there's fifty million cigarette butts outside and there's like doors one through seven and you know behind every single door there's some horriblemisery going on there's someone crying or drunk or lonely or crueland i think oh god she lives here how awfulwe go to the door door number four and she very very quietlykeys inas soon as the door opens i hear the blare of television come out and on the blue light of the television the smoke of a hundred cigarettes in that little crack of lightand i hear the man and he says where were youand she says never mind i'm back and he saysyou alrightand she says yeah i'm alright and then she turns to me and says you want a beer and he says who the fuck is thatand she pulls me over and he sees me and he says oh heyi'm not a threatjust then he takes a drag of his cigarette a very hard hard drag you know the kind that makes the end of it really heat up hot hot hot and long and it's a little scary and i follow the cigarette down because i'm afraid of that head falling off and i'm surprised when i seein the crook of his arm a little boy sleepinga toddler and i thinkand just then the girl reaches underneath the bed and takes out a carton and she taps out the last s pack of cigarettes in there and on the way up she kisses the little boyand then she kisses the man and the man says again you alrightand she says yeah i'm just gonna go out and smoke with herand so we go outside and sit amongst the cigarette butts and smokeand i say wow that's your little boyand she says yeah isn't he beautiful and i say yeah he is he is beautifulhe's my light he keeps me going she sayswe finish ourcigarettes she finishes her beer i don't have a beer cause i can't go home with beer on my breathandshe goes inside to get the keysshe takes too long in there getting the keys and i think something must be wrong and she comes out and she says looki'm really sorry but um like we don't have any gas in the car it's already on e and he needs to get to work in the morning and umi you know i i'm gonna be walk to work as it is so what i did was though here look i drew out this map for you and you're really you're like a mile and a half from home and um if you walk three streets over you'll be back on that pretty street and you just take that and you'll be fine and she alsohas wrapped up in toilet paper seven cigarettes for mea third of her pack i note and a new pack of matchesand she tells me good bye and that was great to meet you and how lucky and that was fun and you knowlet's be friendsandi say yeah ok and i walk away but i kind of know we're not gonna be friendsi might not ever see her againand i kind of know i don't think she's ever going to be a vetand i cross and i walk away and maybe this would've seemed like a visit from my possible future and scary but it kind of does the opposite on the walk home i'm like manthat was really grim over thereand i'm going home nowto mynice boyfriend and he is gonna be so extra happy to see me andwe have a one bedroom apartment and we havetwo trees and there's a yard and we have this jar in the kitchen where there's like loose money that we can use for anything like we would never ever run out of gas and um i don't have a baby you know so i can leavewhenever i wanti smoked all seven cigarettes on the way homeand people who have never smoked cigarettesjust think ickdisgusting and poisonbut unless you've had themand held them dearyou don't know how great they can be and what friends and comfort and kinship they can bringit took me a long time to quitthat boyfriendand then to quit smokingand uh sometimes i still miss the smoking
